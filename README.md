# B-plus-Tree_initialization
this project is about loading data into a B+tree (from a Fixed Ordered Table/List file) using two methods, then a performances comparison is established.
The two methods are : 
1.	Bulk loading.
2.	Standard insertion.

We consider a 127 order B+ tree, 253 values can be inserted into the leaves. In our study, the following quantities are taken into consideration : 
- Execution time .
- Space occupied by the B+tree .
- Disk accesses .
- Loading rate .
- Tree depth .
